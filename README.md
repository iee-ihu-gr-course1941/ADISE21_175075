## Card game called Moutzouris

- ## **Target of the game**
   The object of the game is to run out of cards. The one who will be left with a card is the loser.

- ## **Preparation**
   Before you start, remove all the figures from the deck and hold only Riga Bastouni.

- ## **Game process**
   After mixing well, we deal the whole deck to the players so that they all have the same number of cards (or + - 1). Each player removes from the cards he has in his hands the pairs, that is, 2 Aces 2 doubles 2 threes etc. We hold the rest in our hands like fans so that the other child can choose, without seeing them, one of them. The first player draws a card from the one sitting to his left, if he pairs the new card with some of his own then he throws them, otherwise he holds them and the reason is on his right. Whoever pairs all his cards leaves the game. Whoever stays last with King of Spades (Moutzouris) in his hand is the loser, and the other players decide his penalty.
